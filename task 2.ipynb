      "Input: Explain how thunderstorms form\n",
      "Output: Thunderstorms form through a complex process involving atmospheric instability, moisture, and lift.  Here's a breakdown of the stages:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Lifting Condensation Level (LCL):**  Warm, moist air near the surface needs to rise. This can happen in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Convection:**  The sun heats the ground, warming the air above it.  This warm air becomes less dense than the surrounding air and rises. This is the most common way thunderstorms form.\n",
      "* **Frontal Lifting:**  When a warm air mass meets a cold air mass, the warmer, less dense air is forced to rise over the colder air.  This is common along weather fronts.\n",
      "* **Orographic Lifting:**  Air is forced to rise as it encounters a mountain or hill.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the air rises, it cools and expands.  Eventually, it reaches its dew point – the temperature at which the air becomes saturated and condensation begins. This point is the LCL.  Clouds start to form.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Cumulus Stage:**  The rising air continues to cool and condense, forming a cumulus cloud.  This cloud is characterized by its puffy, cotton-like appearance.  As more moisture condenses, the cloud grows taller and wider.  Light to moderate rain might start to fall.  This stage is relatively benign.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Mature Stage:**  This is the most intense stage of the thunderstorm.  Strong updrafts (rising air) and downdrafts (sinking air) coexist within the cloud.  The updrafts continue to fuel the cloud's growth, often creating an anvil shape at the top as the rising air spreads out in the stratosphere.  Heavy rain, hail, strong winds, and frequent lightning are common during this stage.  The downdrafts can create strong outflow winds at the surface, sometimes leading to gust fronts and even tornadoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Dissipating Stage:**  As the downdrafts become dominant, they cut off the supply of warm, moist air to the updrafts. This causes the storm to weaken.  The rain gradually lessens, and the cloud begins to dissipate.  This stage can last for 30 minutes to an hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Ingredients for Thunderstorm Formation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Moisture:**  Abundant atmospheric moisture is crucial for the formation of clouds and precipitation.\n",
      "* **Instability:**  A significant difference in temperature between the surface air and the upper atmosphere creates instability, allowing for strong updrafts.\n",
      "* **Lift:**  A mechanism to force the warm, moist air to rise, such as convection, frontal lifting, or orographic lifting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all thunderstorms are created equal.  Some are relatively weak and short-lived, while others can be severe, producing damaging hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. The severity depends on the strength of the updrafts, the amount of wind shear (change in wind speed and direction with height), and other atmospheric factors.\n",
